# HashTableGUI
This repository contains three Python GUI applications demonstrating hash table implementations with different functionalities, built using Tkinter.

## Projects
### 1. Basic Hash Table GUI
A simple hash table implementation where users can:

Add, search for, and delete values.
Choose from multiple hash functions (hash, middle-square hash, and transformation radix).
Handle collisions using linear probing.

### 2. Key-Value Hash Table GUI
An extended version that supports:

Adding, searching for, and deleting key-value pairs.
Collision handling using linear probing.
A simple hash function based on the sum of ASCII values of characters in the key.

### 3. Improved Key-Value Hash Table GUI
An enhanced version of the key-value hash table that includes:

A GUI for entering key-value pairs with improved layout.
Additional error handling for input validation.
A more structured approach to managing the hash table and its interactions.
