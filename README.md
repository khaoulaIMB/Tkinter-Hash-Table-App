# Tkinter-Hash-Table-App
This is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for demonstrating hash table operations, built using Tkinter in Python. The application allows users to add, search, and delete values in a hash table with different hashing algorithms.

##Features

Hash Table Operations: Add, search, and delete values from the hash table.
Hash Functions:
Python's built-in hash() function.
Middle Square Hash.
Transformation Radix Hash.
Collision Handling: Linear probing is used to resolve hash collisions.
Treeview Table: Displays the current state of the hash table in a dynamic table.

##Requirements

Python 3.x
Tkinter (built-in with Python)

##How It Works

Adding Values: Enter a value in the input field and press "Add". The value will be hashed using the selected hash function and inserted into the hash table.
Searching Values: Enter a value and press "Search" to find the location of the value in the table.
Deleting Values: Enter a value and press "Delete" to remove it from the table.
Selecting Hash Function: Choose between the built-in Python hash, the Middle Square hash, or the Transformation Radix hash from the drop-down menu.
